# Object Collection Robot
This robot was designed to collect different colored objects and deposit them in a collection basket. It was designed, built, and programmed over two weeks with a team of 4 including myself. 
# My role
I wrote all of the code for the robot and assisted in the construction and design of the physical structure.
